# shiny-pancake
Just an initial repo to kick things off on my new account
Going thru a tutorial and this edit is part of that
#########################################################
Actually I've changed my mind, I'm going to use this repo
for work that I'm doing with the book C++ Primer Plus. I'm
going to put code in here that is from examples and exercises
that I'm working through in the book, as well as other C++ books.
